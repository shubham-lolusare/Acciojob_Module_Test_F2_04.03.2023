- Figma Link: https://www.figma.com/file/0XTN5vVszisgjoj9fXw3at/Blogging-Website?node-id=0%3A1&t=ffykZJydX7vZyeqz-1

# Requirements:
- The website should have a static header with a "Create a Blog" button. By default, the page should not show any blog posts.
- A modal should appear when a user clicks on the "Create a Blog" button. The modal should contain a form allowing users to input their blog post's title and description. The title input should be type text, while the description should be a textbox. The modal should include an "X" button to allow the user to close it.
- After the user saves/publishes their blog post, it should appear on the main page with the UI shown in the Figma link.
- Users should be able to edit or delete their blog posts. If a user clicks the delete button, the selected blog post should be removed from the page. If a user clicks the edit button, a modal should appear with the title and description already filled out, allowing the user to edit the post.
- Allow the user to view their search history and click on previous search queries to view the book data again.
- The website should have a responsive UI, and the modals should work properly on all screen sizes.
- The website should be deployed and accessible online.
